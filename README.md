**Ferblatin**
<ol>
  <li>Convert.cpp -> Converts text into ferblatin. Haven't implemented support for symbols like '.', '?', ':', ','</li>
  <li>Use text.txt with convert.cpp. Just put them in the same folder and it should work out.</li>
  <li>Translate.cpp -> Has support to implement the convert.cpp file into the same file. I left the class Word in the header.h file.</li>
  <li>Use translate.txt with translate.cpp to translate the words. Can use convert.cpp to write converted word to translate.txt.</li>
</ol>

*Let me know if you have any questions!*
